1. Objective
To develop a system that collects social media conversations, analyzes their content using natural language processing (NLP), and classifies the underlying emotions to uncover public sentiment trends around specific topics or events.

2. Functional Requirements
a. Data Collection
Collect posts or comments from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Instagram).

Allow user to specify a keyword/topic (e.g., "mental health", "climate change").

Store text content for further analysis.

b. Text Preprocessing
Clean and normalize raw text:

Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis, special characters.

Convert text to lowercase.

Handle contractions and slang.

c. Emotion Detection
Use a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., DistilRoBERTa) to detect and classify emotions such as:

Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Love, Surprise, etc.

Assign a probability score for each emotion per post.

d. Sentiment Aggregation
Compute average emotion distribution across all posts.

Optionally, group results by:

Date/time

Topic

User demographics (if available)

e. Visualization
Generate visual summaries:

Bar chart of average emotion scores

Pie chart of dominant emotions

Time-series plot (if time data is collected)

f. Export/Report
Allow users to download:

Raw analyzed data (CSV/JSON)

Summary report (PDF/PNG of charts)

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Should handle at least 500 posts in under 1 minute.

Accuracy: Use a state-of-the-art model trained for emotion classification (preferably transformer-based).

Scalability: Code should allow switching or adding more platforms easily.

Usability: Simple CLI or web interface to enter topic and view results.

4. Technological Requirements
Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries:

snscrape or API wrappers for data collection

transformers, torch for NLP model

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

Environment: Can run on local machine or deployable to cloud/streamlit app
